What you know about rollin' down in the deep? <br>
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze <br>
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah <br>
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy <br>

She say that I'm cool (damn straight) <br>
I'm like, "Yeah, that's true" (that's true) <br>
I believe in G-O-D (ayy) <br>
Don't believe in T-H-O-T <br>
She keep playing me dumb (play me) <br>
I'ma play her for fun (uh-huh) <br>
Y'all don't really know my mental <br>
Lemme give you the picture like stencil <br>
Falling out, in a drought <br>
No flow, rain wasn't pouring down (pouring down) <br>
See, that pain was all around <br>
See, my mode was kinda lounged <br>
Didn't know which-which way to turn <br>
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt <br>
Energy up, you can feel my surge <br>
I'ma kill everything like this purge (ayy) <br>
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work <br>
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (get it) <br>
Everything that I do is electric <br>
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it moving like kinetic, ayy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame <br>
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate <br>
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank <br>
Have you walkin' on a plank, la-la-la-la-la, like <br>
Both hands together, God, let me pray (now let me pray) <br>
Uh, I've been going right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf) <br>
Pass the baton, back to them all <br>
Swimming in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh <br>
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign <br>
Can you please read between the lines? <br>
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine <br>
They say that I'm so fine <br>
You could never match my grind (true) <br>
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf) <br>
